# 2048-Game
This is the first trial group project in my programming school and I decided to write this game with one collegue. This project is just our own realization of famous 2048 game. First of all I developed an diagramm as launching pad for us. Then we separeted it to the different parts and tasks for each of us and start to realize. The game saves different players through their nicknames, and each player's progress to the MySQL data base as save points and players, therefore, a player can start new game or load last savepoint. Also a player can undo last three movements, mean, to make three steps back to the previous states durring the game process.
